# STL Ruby RTanque

[RTanque](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque) is a game for Ruby programmers. Player program the brain of a tank and then send that tank to battle other tanks.

Implementing a tank brain may sound like a difficult and time consuming task, but the API is pretty straightfoward and easy to use. I made a simple bot in less than an hour and about 30 lines of code that is not easy to beat with the keyboard controled bot.
